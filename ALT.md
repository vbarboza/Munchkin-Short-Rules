# Rules

## Setup

### Race

A player's race won't change during the game (unless he/she is cursed or killed).

- Race cards have "race" at the bottom of the card.
- Scramble the race cards + Half-Breed cards from the door stack.
- Each player draws a card from this set and play it immediately.
  - _A Half-Breed should draws 2 more cards from this set._
  - _If a Half-Breed draws the same race card twice, race penalties won't apply._

**Rationale:** Unexperienced players will get used to race abilities and race exclusive items.

### Class

A player's class won't change during the game (unless he/she is cursed or killed).

- Class cards have "class" at the bottom of the card.
- Scramble the class cards + Super Munchkin cards from the door stack.
- Each player draws a card from this set and play it immediately.
  - _A Super Munchkin draws 2 more cards from this set._
  - _If a Super Munchkin draws the same class card twice, penalties won't apply._
  
**Rationale:** Unexperienced players will get used to class abilities and class exclusive items.

### Door stack

Keep only monsters and curses in the door stack. It implies not only in removing the race and class cards as described before, but also the "spells".

- Monster cards have a level and name at the top of the card and "_some-number Treasures_" at the bottom.
- Curse cards have "_Curse!_" at the top of the card.

** Rationale:** It makes things simple - you either fight a monster or get cursed.

### Treasure stack

Add the remaining door cards here. (And forget about the cards cover! They are not "room" cards anymore)

### Players

- Scramble the door stack.
- Scramble the treasure stack.
- Give each player 4 cards from each stack.
- Write down each player level. Everyone starts at level 1.

## Playing

Roll the dice to decide the playing order.

During a player's turn, he/she should:

1. Discard or trade cards
2. Equip items
3. Open the door or look for trouble
4. Get cursed or fight the monster
5. Ask for help or run away

Meanwhile, other players can:

* Trade items
* Cast spells
* Curse
* Offer help

### Discarding or trading a card

A player can discard any card from its hand at any time, without replacing it with anything from the stacks.

Another option is trading with other players given none of them is fighting a monster.

### Equipping an item

If an item is not race or class exclusive, you can equip it.

* _Try not bothering with sizes (big/small), handling (1H/2H) or armor multiple armor pieces initially. Add constraints when players are comfortable with the items and have gained more experience._

### Opening the door or looking for trouble

When a player is satisfied with its hand and equipment, he or she can chose between drawing a card from the door deck ("Open the door") or playing a monster from hand ("Looking for trouble").

* If the player draws a curse, it takes effect immediately and the turn ends here.
* If the player plays or draws a monster, it has to fight it, ask for help or try to run away.
* _Only **1 action** is taken here and there is no "Loot the Room"._
* _As there is no "Loot the Room", play monsters and curses carefully. You only draw them at the beginning of the game or after a death._

## Fighting a monster

"Fighting a monster" follows the original rules.

 - If your level plus bonuses add up to more than the monster, you win. You only get level(s) from **killing** monster(s), not making them disappear, etc.
 - If you and the monster are tied, or the monster has more than you, you lose. Ask for help, or try to run away. 
 - If more monsters are in the battle, beat their total strength. You can defeat one and try to Run Away from the other, though. 

### Asking for help

"Asking for help" follows the original rules.

 - Only one player can help you if you cannot defeat a monster by yourself.
 - Players will want some of the treasure if they help. Agree on who gets what and who picks first before helping. 
 - Every bonus the helper can add to the fight applies. 
 - The helper does not gain levels, only treasure, unless a card specifies otherwise.
 - If you cannot defeat the monster(s), you both have to Run Away.

### Running away

"Running away" follows the original rules.

 - Roll the dice. If you get a 5 or more, you escape. If not, read the monster card and do what the "Bad Stuff" is. 
 - You have to Run Away from each separate monster (roll for each monster).

## Items

- Selling items for 1000 Gold gets you a level.

* _No other constraints are added here for simplicity's sake._

## Curses

"Curses" follow the original rules.

 - Curses in your hand can be played at any time on any player. 
 - The victim chooses what item a multiple-item curse applies to.

## Death

- If you die, you lose everything, except for your level.
- The other players pick **one** item each, following the playing order.
- On your next turn, draw a new race and class and four cards from each deck, like when the game began.

## General Rules

- When a card has been played it cannot be taken back into your hand.
- You can **only** reach a level 10 by killing a monster.
- You can never have a lower level than 1.
